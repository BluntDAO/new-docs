# üó≥Ô∏è Putting in A Proposal

Either you put a proposal or get an "Ouncer" - someone who owns the blunts.wtf NFT to put on your behalf



The minimum threshold to put in a proposal. If you don't have this threshold a good way to lobby for a proposal is to first pitch the idea in discord, telegram, or our charmverse forum. Make sure to have ETH on BASE network to submit transactions, around \~ cents based on [gas fees](https://gasfees.io)
