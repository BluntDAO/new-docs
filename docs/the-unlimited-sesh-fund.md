## Objectives

* Make sure blunts get smoked 
* Create a self sustaining treasury for unlimited joints, blunts, other stick based items based on NFT ownership
* Give incentives for people to onboard others via Proof of Sesh
* Build brand, gain revenue with other partnerships
* Bleed into culture everyday culture
* Create something iconic like hoggles (high noggles) and proliferate that brand



## How It Works

Everyday a new OUNCE is auctioned off on BASE using ETH. All that money goes to thre treasury to fund IRL (in real life) seshes and to expand the BluntDAO open source brand. In order to submit a proposal on-chain you must have 0.1% of supply (so 1 NFT until there is 1000+ NFTs \~ 2.5 years). If you do not have this rally a proposal ([instructions](the-unlimited-sesh-fund/putting-in-a-proposal.md) here)



1/4.20 of the OUNCES go towards the OG Validator shortlist based on retroactive contributions. People from the original BluntDAO who have done significant work.

* If through nouns.build then 2.5% goes to Zora's Builder DAO. Reccomend use blunts.wtf app
* `Duration:` How long an auction runs for: 1 day
* `Reserve Price:` Minimum bid amount required to start an auction. **0.021 ETH around ($60+ depending on price of Eth)**
* `Proposal Threshold:` Min percent of total votes (NFTs) balance needed to put a proposal to a vote.: **0.1%**
* `Quorum Threshold:` Min percent of total **For** votes (NFTs) required for a proposal to pass. **10% required**. Example, if a proposal does not get 10% of NFT holders by the end of proposal, proposal will fail.



Additionally votes can be delegated to other accounts to streamline active voting.
